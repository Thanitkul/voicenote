<p>"The Emperor is the light against which no darkness can stand."
    "Though the humans of the Adeptus Astartes are the mightiest incarnation of mankind, this does not place the value of an unaltered human any lower than our own. To treat those we are charged to protect as an unworthy burden, rather than our sworn wards, is to defy the will of the Emperor of Mankind."
    The foolish and the ignorant may think themselves slaves of the Imperium. True slavery is only knowable by the thralls of the Dark Gods, whose lives and souls are forfeit to the hunger of their uncaring, insatiable lords. Only the Emperor may grant liberation to the souls of man in death
    "Compassion towards the innocent and loyalty to mankind is the savior of the Adeptus Astartes, as it is for all humanity. It separates us from servants of Chaos, and guides us in the footsteps of the Emperor himself."
    "Waste you not the lives of the faithful, though they be beset on all sides by xenos or heretics. Purge those who will carry the taint, but harm none who pose no risk to their fellow Imperials."
    "An Asartes who is hesitant to die for any of his Battle-Brothers is no true Astartes at all. He is lower than a beast, for he has become a traitor."
    "The Faithful Guardsman is the truest and most noble of all Imperials, for he fights knowing his death to be brutal and likely, without the armor or arms of the Imperium's elite troops. He keeps faith for the sake of his species, and it is only by their deaths by the millions each day that the Imperium is protected and maintained."
    The Adepta Sororitas are among the most sacred of all the servants of His Will, for their faith is bottomless. Aspire to believe as they do.
    The Inquisitor is the appointed representative of the Emperor's Will, and the executor of His judgment. Obey them in all things lest you have true purpose to doubt their loyalty, though their demands may weigh heavy on your heart.
    The Tech-Priest is holy for he is the embodiment of the knowledge that protects humanity, and serves his species endlessly. Though his flesh may have been replaced by metal, a true Adept of the Mechanicus is a faithful servant of the Emperor.
